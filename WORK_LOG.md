The first puzzle was a caesar cipher. Second one was ASCII. Third one was ASCII in binary. |
| Aug 22 |  17:05-17:35  | Started working on the 4th puzzle. I converted each emoji into bytes (each took up 3 bytes) and noticed that they each started with the same byte, so I ignored it for now. The second byte had some changes (100 or 101) but I ignored it for now. I noticed all the 100 bytes where *almost* within a 2*24 number range (2 times alphabet + symbols in between upper and lower in ascii table), so I added 128 to each number (to make them positive) and then added 65 to get the lowest number to line up with the letter A and noticed that almost everything lined up. There where only a few wrong characters, those where the second byte was 101. I assumed that the most common third byte for the 101 category was a space, and noticed that adding 128 to that byte would result in 31, 1 off from the space character in the ascii table, so I added 129. That resolved all of the issues with 101 group bytes and got me all of the missing symbols. |
