# The Riddler
#### A puzzle created by Zach Blick for Adventures in Algorithms at Menlo School in Atherton, CA

## Your goal
Complete the four decryption functions to decrypt the four secret messages.
These messages are included in four text files in the
`test_files` folder.

The function headers are in the `Riddler` java file. Write your code there.

A tester file has been provided for you. It utilizes junit tests.
To use this test file, run either the entire thing or individual tests (one at a time).
You can initiate the tests by clicking on the arrow to the left of the test's
header or by right-clicking on the test and clicking "run."
